                    <h4><strong>Proffesional career</strong></h4>
                    <h5><strong>Boston Celtics</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge dealt away the team's No. 1
                        overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers in hopes that he could acquire
                        another valuable draft pick and still target the player he actually wanted, Tatum. They selected
                        him with the third overall pick, which they received from Philadelphia. He was the Celtics
                        second straight No. 3 pick for a small forward, following Jaylen Brown in 2016. During the
                        2017 NBA Summer League event in Utah, he displayed his abilities to effect, averaging 18.7
                        points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 steals, and 2.0 assists in nearly 33 minutes of action. Later, in Las
                        Vegas, Tatum produced similar results, averaging 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 0.8
                        blocks in nearly 32 minutes of action in the three games he was allowed to play. He was named to
                        the All-Summer League Second Team alongside Bryn Forbes, Cheick Diallo, Wayne Selden Jr., and
                        Kyle Kuzma.
                        <br>
                        In his NBA debut, Tatum recorded a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds as the team's
                        starting power forward in a 102–99 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Tatum then recorded a
                        season-high 24 points in a win over the New York Knicks on October 24, 2017. He was named
                        the Eastern Conference's Rookie of The Month for December 2017.
                        <br>
                        The Celtics finished the season with a record of 55–27, entering the 2018 NBA playoffs as the
                        second seed in the Eastern Conference. In Game 1 of the first-round series against the seventh
                        seed Milwaukee Bucks, Tatum recorded a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds. In Game
                        4 he broke his playoff-high with 21 points, and then broke it again in Game 6 with 22. The
                        Celtics defeated the Bucks in Game 7 by a score of 112–96, with Tatum scoring 20 points.
