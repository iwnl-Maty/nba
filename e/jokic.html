                    <h5><strong>Mega Basket (2012-2015)</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Jokić played youth basketball in Vojvodina Srbijagas, where he became a
                        dominant figure and received interest from bigger teams. In the summer of 2012, Jokić signed a
                        contract with Mega Vizura, although in the first season with the team he played mostly for their
                        junior team in 2012–13. At the age of 17, he appeared in 5 games of the Serbian League and
                        averaged 1.8 points and 2 rebounds in 10.2 minutes per game. In the 2013–14 season, he saw more
                        minutes on the court for the senior team. Over 25 Adriatic League games, he averaged 11.4
                        points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. He also played 13 games with the team in the
                        Serbian League and had similar production, averaging 10.9 points, 6 rebounds and 3.3 assists per
                        game.
                        <br>
                        On June 26, 2014, Jokić was selected by the Denver Nuggets with the 41st overall pick in the
                        2014 NBA draft and following this and the departure of Ratko Varda, he became one of the
                        team leaders in the 2014–15 season. In the first game of the Adriatic League, he led his team to
                        a 103–98 win over MZT Skopje, by scoring 27 points and grabbing 15 rebounds for a total index
                        rating of 44. He was named the MVP of Round 1. On November 3, he recorded 17 points,
                        12 rebounds and season-high 8 assists for a total index rating of 40, in a 90–84 victory over
                        Zadar. For such performance, he was named the MVP of the Round 6. On February 7, he
                        scored 27 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a 77–88 loss to Szolnoki Olaj. He was named the
                        MVP of the Round for the third time in a season. For his performances over the month, he was
                        named the MVP for February, having averaged 21.7 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. On March
                        21, he scored a season-high 28 points and added 15 rebounds to help his team win with 100–96
                        over Igokea. He was named the MVP of the Round 26, his fourth Round MVP award over the
                        season. Even though Mega Leks finished in 10th place in the Adriatic League, Jokić became
                        one of the league's most valuable players. Over 24 games played, he averaged 15.4 points,
                        league-leading 9.3 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, while leading the league with the index
                        rating of 22. On March 26, he was officially named the Adriatic League regular season
                        MVP. He was also named the ABA League Top Prospect for the 2014–15 season.

                    <h5><strong>Denver Nuggets</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                        In the summer of 2015, Jokić joined the Denver Nuggets, one season after being drafted. On July
                        28, 2015, he signed a contract with the Nuggets after averaging 8.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in
                        five summer league games for the team. On November 18, 2015, he had a then season-best game
                        with 23 points and 12 rebounds in a 109–98 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On January 10,
                        2016, he recorded a career-high nine assists in a 95–92 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On
                        February 1, he recorded career highs of 27 points and 14 rebounds in a 112–93 win over the
                        Toronto Raptors. On April 8, he set a new career high with 15 rebounds in a 102–98 win over
                        the San Antonio Spurs. At the season's end, he finished third in the 2016 NBA Rookie of the
                        Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors.
                        <br>
                        On July 9, 2018, Jokić signed a five-year, $148 million maximum contract extension with the
                        Nuggets. On October 20, 2018, in the Nuggets' second game of the season, Jokić recorded
                        35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 119–91 win over the Phoenix Suns. He joined Wilt
                        Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to post a triple-double with 30 or more points
                        without missing a field goal—Chamberlain did it twice, in 1966 and 1967. He also became just
                        the second Nugget to record a triple-double in the first two games of the season, joining Fat
                        Lever. Jokić went on to earn Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the first week
                        of the season, becoming the sixth player in franchise history to win the award three or more
                        times, joining Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson and Chauncey
                        Billups. On November 3, he had a season-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds to go with seven
                        points in a 103–88 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 9, he had a season-high 37 points and
                        tied his career best with 21 rebounds in a 112–110 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. For his
                        efforts in 2018, he was recognized as the Serbian Player of the Year by the Basketball
                        Federation of Serbia.
                        <br>
                        On January 5, he scored a then season-high 39 points in a 123–110 win over the Charlotte
                        Hornets. His second Player of the Week honor came for games played from December 31 to
                        January 6.
